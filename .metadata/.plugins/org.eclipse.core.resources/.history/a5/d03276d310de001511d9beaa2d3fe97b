    My first test on Applets. This first test, it's going to produce a
    pop - up window!

	 I'm going to pain something on screen; and to do it, I have to invoke the
    paint method of the Applet [one of the fouth methods of the Applet class!]
    ***************
    Graphics extends from java.awt.*; 
   Contains all of the classes for creating user interfaces 
   and for painting graphics and images.
   
   Here isn't any main method because an Applet would run
   on browser; the browser would take care all the stuff :)!
